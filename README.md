# Integer-Combinations-by-Rolling-a-Dice

The idea for the problem solving in this colab come from a question in a Facebook post: 

*Using a standard six-sided die, it is possible to obtain a specific sum by rolling the die one or more times. For instance, the sum of 3 can be achieved in four ways: $1+1+1$, $1+2$, $2+1$, and $3$. How many different ways are there to obtain the sum of $7$?*
